# Sonic Adventure DX Mod Manager Classic

SADX Mod Manager Classic is a mod manager for Sonic Adventure DX PC. It's an updated version of MainMemory's original SADX Mod Manager, which was discontinued in 2023.

SADX Mod Manager Classic is a streamlined alternative to the [SA Mod Manager](https://github.com/X-Hax/SA-Mod-Manager) with lower system requirements and higher compatibility, as well as a familiar, simple and fast user interface.


## System Requirements

To use SADX Mod Manager Classic, you must have:
* Windows XP or above
* .NET Framework 4.0 or any other version up to 4.8.1
* Any of the following versions of Sonic Adventure DX PC:
    * US (2004)
	* Steam or Dreamcast Collection Remastered (2016)
	* EU (2004)
	* Best Buy (2004)
	* Korean release by SONOKONG (2004)
	* Sonic PC Collection (2009)

### Notes

1) SADX Mod Manager Classic is meant to be used with the latest version of the [SADX Mod Loader](https://github.com/X-Hax/sadx-mod-loader), which it installs. Some mods made for the Mod Loader may have higher system requirements than the Mod Manager.

2) The Mod Loader is only compatible with the US (2004) version of SADX PC. Upon installation, the Manager will convert other versions of the game to make them compatible with the Mod Loader.
